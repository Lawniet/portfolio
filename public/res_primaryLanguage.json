The contents were arranged in cards to facilitate the visualization of the items, Breadcrumbs were also used (despite the small scope) to facilitate navigation, a responsive side menu, and responsive tags for images and icons. For the application of the style, a CSS file inspired by responsive technologies such as Normalize and Bootstrap was created, from which the hard coded components were created.",
